# Spotify-Dashboard (PowerBI, Excel, PowerQuary, DAX)

## 📌 Introduction

This project transforms Spotify’s **Top 50 dataset** into an **interactive dashboard** that helps stakeholders (music analysts, playlist managers, marketing teams) gain actionable insights. The dashboard enables monitoring of KPIs, song/artist performance, trends, and comparisons in an easy-to-understand format.

* ❌ **No explicit vs non-explicit analysis** → ✅ Compare **explicit vs clean songs**.
* ❌ **No visibility of song/album distribution** → ✅ Breakdown by **album type & year**.
* ❌ **Missing trend insights** → ✅ Track **monthly & yearly popularity trends**.
* ❌ **Artist vs Song-level gap** → ✅ Drill-down to detailed **artist/song pages**.
